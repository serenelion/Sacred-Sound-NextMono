To refactor your Next.js app so that it has a persistent left sidebar which can be toggled on and off with a hamburger icon, you can follow these steps:

Structure Overview
Sidebar Component: Use the existing Sidebar component located in next-frontend/src/components/sidebar.tsx.
Hamburger Icon: Implement a hamburger icon in a separate component that controls the toggling state of the sidebar.
Mobile Nav: Since you would be removing the MobileNav component located in next-frontend/src/components/mobile-nav.tsx, the mobile navigation functionality should be integrated into the sidebar.
Player Component: Integrate your player component alongside the sidebar to ensure clarity and coherence.
Steps and Code Implementation
Remove the Mobile Navigation: You can delete the mobile-nav.tsx file since you plan to consolidate the navigation.

Create a New Layout Component that includes the sidebar and handles the toggle logic.

Example of a MainLayout.tsx
Create a new file next-frontend/src/components/MainLayout.tsx:

import { useState } from 'react';
import { Sidebar } from './sidebar'; // Import the sidebar component
import { Button } from "@/components/ui/button"; // Adjust the import path as needed
import { cn } from "@/lib/utils"; // Adjust the import path if necessary
export function MainLayout({ children }: { children: React.ReactNode }) {
  const [isSidebarOpen, setIsSidebarOpen] = useState(false);
  const toggleSidebar = () => {
    setIsSidebarOpen(!isSidebarOpen);
  };
  return (
    <div className="flex">
      <Sidebar className={cn("transition-transform", isSidebarOpen ? "translate-x-0" : "-translate-x-full")} />
      <div className="flex-1">
        <Button onClick={toggleSidebar} className="md:hidden">
          {/* Adjust this according to the icon you use */}
          <span className="text-2xl">â˜°</span> 
        </Button>
        {children}
      </div>
    </div>
  );
}
Update the Page Layout: Modify your page layout files, such as layout.tsx, to wrap your components with the MainLayout.
Modify layout.tsx
Edit next-frontend/src/app/layout.tsx to incorporate MainLayout:

import { Inter } from 'next/font/google';
import { Toaster } from 'sonner';
import { AuthProvider } from '@/contexts/auth-context';
import MainLayout from '@/components/MainLayout'; // Import MainLayout
import './globals.css';
const inter = Inter({ subsets: ['latin'] });
export default function RootLayout({ children }: { children: React.ReactNode }) {
  return (
    <html lang="en">
      <body className={inter.className}>
        <AuthProvider>
          <MainLayout>
            {children}
          </MainLayout>
        </AuthProvider>
        <Toaster />
      </body>
    </html>
  );
}
Deleting the Mobile Nav: Finally, once you've verified that the sidebar is working as intended, you can go ahead and delete the mobile-nav.tsx file.
Implementation Prompt
Now that you have the structure and code needed to create a persistent left sidebar with toggle functionality, please implement this refactoring in your codebase. Let me know if you encounter any issues or have further questions!
