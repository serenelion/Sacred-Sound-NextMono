# User Logout API

## Endpoint
`POST /api/logout`

## Description
This endpoint terminates the user's session by invalidating the current authentication token and clearing any session-related cookies. It ensures that the user is logged out securely and cannot access protected resources until they log in again.

## Request
- No request body is required. The endpoint relies on the presence of session cookies or tokens to identify the session to terminate.

## Response
- **Success (200)**: Confirms that the user has been logged out successfully.
  - Example:
    ```json
    {
      "message": "Logged out successfully"
    }
    ```

- **Error (500)**: Indicates a server-side error occurred during the logout process.
  - Example:
    ```json
    {
      "message": "Internal server error"
    }
    ```

## Implementation Details
- The endpoint clears the authentication token stored in HTTP-only cookies, ensuring the session is terminated.
- It may also invalidate the token on the server-side, depending on the token management strategy.
- The response confirms the successful termination of the session.

## Security Considerations
- Use HTTP-only cookies to store authentication tokens, preventing client-side scripts from accessing them.
- Ensure that the logout process is performed over HTTPS to protect data in transit.
- Implement token invalidation mechanisms to prevent reuse of tokens after logout.
- Regularly review and update session management practices to enhance security.
