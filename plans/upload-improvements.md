# Upload Page Improvements Plan

## Current Analysis
The existing upload page (`@next-frontend/src/app/upload/page.tsx`) is a basic implementation that only renders the `UploadChoice` component. Based on the context provided, there are several opportunities for improvement.

## Areas for Enhancement

1. **User Experience**
   - Add loading states
   - Implement progress indicators
   - Add error handling and user feedback
   - Support drag-and-drop uploads

2. **Technical Implementation**
   - Add proper TypeScript types
   - Implement server-side validation
   - Add file type restrictions
   - Implement chunked uploads for large files

3. **UI/UX Flow**
   - Add a breadcrumb navigation
   - Implement multi-step upload process
   - Add preview functionality
   - Improve mobile responsiveness

## Implementation Steps

### Phase 1: Core Structure Enhancement
1. Refactor page.tsx to include proper layout components
2. Add loading and error states
3. Implement proper TypeScript interfaces

### Phase 2: Upload Process Improvements

2. Implement chunked uploads
3. Add progress visualization
4. Add file validation

### Phase 3: UI/UX Refinements
1. Add breadcrumb navigation
2. Implement step indicator
3. Add preview functionality
4. Enhance mobile responsiveness
