   - Add loading states
   - Implement progress indicators
   - Add error handling and user feedback
   - Support drag-and-drop uploads

2. **Technical Implementation**
   - Add proper TypeScript types
   - Implement server-side validation
   - Add file type restrictions
   - Implement chunked uploads for large files

3. **UI/UX Flow**
   - Add a breadcrumb navigation
   - Implement multi-step upload process
   - Add preview functionality
   - Improve mobile responsiveness

## Implementation Steps

### Phase 1: Core Structure Enhancement
1. Refactor page.tsx to include proper layout components
2. Add loading and error states

```
Update upload page with header, breadcrumbs, and proper layout structure
```

### Phase 2: Upload Flow Improvements
1. Add drag-and-drop improvements:
   - Better visual feedback
   - Progress indicators
   - File type validation
   - Size limits
   
2. Implement chunked uploads:
   - Progress tracking per chunk
   - Resume capability
   - Better error handling

Implementation prompt:
```
Enhance file upload handling with chunked uploads and better progress tracking

```

### Phase 5: Upload Process Optimization
1. Implement:
   - Background uploads
   - Queue management
   - Retry mechanisms
   - Offline support

Implementation prompt:
```
Add background upload processing and queue management
```

## Technical Requirements
- TypeScript for type safety
- Server-side validation
- Proper error handling
- Progress tracking/reporting
- Mobile responsiveness

## Success Metrics
- Reduced upload failures
- Improved upload completion rates
- Better metadata accuracy
- Increased batch upload efficiency
- Reduced support requests

This plan provides a structured approach to improving the upload functionality while maintaining consistency with the existing architecture.
